//OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING
//- The oop principles help to bind data together and the
// functions that operate on them so that no other part of the code can access that data except that function.
//- For these we use Access Modifiers(They define the access type of the method from where it can be accessed in the application)
//- These access modifiers include:
            //Public: accessible in all classes of your app
            //Protected: accessible within the package in which is defined and its subclasses
            //Private: only accessible within the class
            //Default: Within the same class and package defined in

//The OOP principles are as follows:
//ABSTRACTION: This displays essential details to a user and leaving out the complex bits e.g, A car is viewed as a car not its individual parts
//              - This is achieved by interfaces and abstract classes.

//ENCAPSULATION: Wrapping data under one unit.It is a shield that prevents data being accessed outside the shield
//              - This is achieved by declaring all the variables in a class as private and
//              writing public methods in the class to set and get the values of the variables

//INHERITANCE- This is the mechanism by which one class(child) is allowed to inherit features
//              (fields and methods) of another class (parent/base)
//           - We achieve this by use of the word "extends"

//POLYMORPHISM - This is the ability to differentiate between entities with the same name efficiently.
//             - The ability to appear in many forms is called polymorphism.achieved by either OVER RIDING/OVER LOADING
//             - Over loading: methods have same name but different signatures(signatures differ by the number of input parameters/Types of input/both)
//             - Overriding: this allows a subclass or child class to provide a  method that is in the parent class
